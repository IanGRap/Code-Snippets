These are some of the programs I worked on for the GDA collaboration game Bottom Gun. 
There is far more code in the game, many of which I helped work on.
However, these were written primarily by me, but as with all code in our projects there was constant collaboration and tweaking of one another's code.
I've tried to go through and comment instances where I specifically got code from others.

The other people programmers on this project were:

Justin Tran
Kris Paz
Aidan Murphy
Jarrett van den Bergh
Andrew Gwinner
Victoria Lima
Yuval Shabtai
Saikrishna Rao
